# Public API Tutorial

A free way to host simple text-based data.

## Description

Guide on how to implement your own publically hosted API. With utilization of the github pages service, individuals can call on a url to .fetch or GET json data. To test the viability of the method, utilize [this link](https://loreleim.github.io/publicapi/data/data.json) in your .fetch() or get request. This dataset features chicken breeds that hatch colorful eggs.

## Designing Your Own

- [ ] create a new github repo
- [ ] enable github pages: github repo code page > settings > options > scroll down > Github Pages > select master branch
- [ ] clone your repo to your local machine
- [ ] create an index.html in the project directory
- [ ] create a js folder
- [ ] create a index.js within the js folder
- [ ] create a data folder
- [ ] create a data.json within the data folder

## Case Usage

- [ ] Recipe search app
- [ ] UFO sighting map
- [ ] Home inventory

## Limitations

As designed through a github repository, we're at the limitation of READ-ONLY data.
So if you're looking for free alternatives for read/write APIs, I would reccommend taking a look at these services.

- [ ] Firebase via Google
- [ ] Django via Python
- [ ] Azure via AWS

Again, those frameworks come at the mercy of pay per read/write. But they enable the complexity of communication-based apps.
